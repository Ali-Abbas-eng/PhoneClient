# Phone Client (Android/IOS) Repository
A Flutter-based code to provide the look and feel of our AI system.

# What to install
- First of all, you need to have python installed on your device (Python 3.11.4 is preferred).
- Download the Android SDK directly from Google by going to this link (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads). Another way to do that is to download
  an IDE for Android like `Android Studio` or `IntelliJ IDEA` (preferred) and upon its installation, it will ask you weither you want to download the SDKs and link them.

# Launch the app
- Once all previously mentioned packages are installed, open a console (cmd, powershell, ...) and navigate to the phoneclient dierectory.
- Run the command `npm install` to install of the phoneclient's dependencies.
- Run the command `npm install expo` to install the expo package which is needed to run the app.
- Run the command `npx expo start`, after which a list of commands should appear. Press `a` to launch the app on an android emulator (`IntelliJ IDEA` is preferred).
- You can now navigate to "phoneclient/node_modules/App.js", edit it and rerun the app using the previous step to see your changes.
